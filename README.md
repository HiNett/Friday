# Friday, the tool that lets you go away for the weekend on Friday ⚡️

Friday is a project that began in May 2024, by a student who wanted to have a project management platform on which he could carry out all his project management tasks on a single platform.

The entire project is supervised by [DELILLE Elone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elonedelille/), so feel free to contact me with any questions.
